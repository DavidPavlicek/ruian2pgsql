Usage: java -jar ruian2pgsql-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar --db-connection-url <value>
    [--create-tables] [--reset-transaction-ids] [--dry-run] --input-dir <value>
    [--log-file <value>]

Where:
--create-tables
        creates database tables for the data (if tables with the same name
        already exists, it is first dropped)
--db-connection-url
        is JDBC connection URL, for example:
        jdbc:postgresql://localhost/ruian?user=ruian&password=p4ssw0rd
--dry-run
        processes all specified files but no data are written to database
--input-dir
        is directory that contains downloaded .xml.gz files
--log-file
        is optional specification of log file (if not specified, log will be
        output to console)
--ignore-invalid-gml
        if GML definition is not valid, application ignores the definition and
        saves the object without the definition (if this parameter is not
        specified, application throws exception and exits while trying to save
        invalid GML definition, the drawback of this parameter is that it makes
        the import little bit slower because each GML definition is checked
        twice - once during the check and the other time during saving in
        database)
--reset-transaction-ids
        resets RÃšIAN transaction ids so that following data import will update
        all data (data are updated only if new transaction id is greater than
        transaction id that is stored in database - this feature is useful in
        case you want to regenerate your data because of some issue with
        previous import, without deleting all data and starting with fresh
        database)
